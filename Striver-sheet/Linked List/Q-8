//Leetcode: Detect cycle in a linked list 
//https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/submissions/983678012/

****BRUTE FORCE: A node pointing on head, traverse another node through whole ll and check if they become equal but if another pointer becomes NULL then increment the first pointer.
  
***BETTER APPRAOCH
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* slow = head,*fast = head;
        while(fast && fast->next){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if(slow==fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
